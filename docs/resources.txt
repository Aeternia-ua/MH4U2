Tabletop.js https://gist.github.com/jsvine/3295633

@zzolo & @cperryk -- Look in the Tabletop.js repo's "caching" folder, there are two scripts that create a locally-cached version. jsoma/flatware is another option if you want something a bit more dynamic. Personally, I just used the snippet from here to save a local version of the Json object and then provided that to my existing code with jQuery's getJSON() method (Ultimately replacing the Tabletop.js calls).

Another option would be to export your production spreadsheet as a JSON file and then call it in with a getJSON().
